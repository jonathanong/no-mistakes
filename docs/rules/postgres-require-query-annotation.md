# `postgres-require-query-annotation`

Require a leading `/* name */` block comment on executed PostgreSQL SQL so
slow-query logs and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` can name the statement. Line comments
(`-- name`) do not count. `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` are exempt.

The rule uses the shared PostgreSQL embedded-SQL facts
(`extract_embedded_sql_from_source`, `collect_postgres_facts`) and
`sql_requires_query_annotation`. It does not re-parse TypeScript with a
private parser.

```yaml
rules:
  - rule: postgres-require-query-annotation
    scope: repository
    options:
      include: ["src/**/*.ts"]
      exclude: ["src/generated/**"]
      importSpecifier: "@example/db"
      executorNames: [query, read, write]
```

`importSpecifier` has no default. `executorNames` defaults to `query`, `read`, and `write` only when `importSpecifier` is configured.

Counterexample: `query(\`SELECT id FROM posts\`)`.

```ts
import { query } from "@example/db";

export function list() {
  return query(`SELECT id FROM posts ORDER BY id DESC`);
}
```

Fix: put a non-empty block comment at the start of the executed SQL.

```ts
query(`/* posts/list */ SELECT id FROM posts ORDER BY id DESC`);
```

Use `no-mistakes-disable-next-line postgres-require-query-annotation` or
`no-mistakes-disable-line` for a one-off, or `no-mistakes-disable-file`
when a whole file is an intentional exception.

## Why and when

Use this rule when query logs, slow-query reports, and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output
need a stable operation name rather than an opaque SQL string.

## What it catches/requires

Executed PostgreSQL SQL must begin with a non-empty block comment. `BEGIN`,
`COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` are exempt; line comments do not satisfy the contract.

## Options and defaults

`include` and `exclude` select source files. `importSpecifier` has no default, and `executorNames` defaults to `[query, read, write]` only when `importSpecifier` is configured.

### Executor configuration

Omitting both `importSpecifier` and `executorNames` is a configuration error.
Set `importSpecifier` to your database module or list `executorNames` explicitly.
Use `executorNames: []` without a module to select no executor calls and retain
SQL-file/native-SQL analysis where supported. See the
[executor migration](../migrations/explicit-postgres-executors.md).

| Option            | Default                                                      | Behavior                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `importSpecifier` | Empty                                                        | Set explicitly to your database module to match its named imports.                  |
| `executorNames`   | Empty without a module; `[query, read, write]` with a module | Without a module, only explicitly listed names match named imports from any module. |
| `executorFactoryNames` | Empty | Named imports (from `importSpecifier`, or any module when it is empty) whose call result bound with `const`, `let`, `using`, or `await using` is an executor inside the declaring block. |
| `executorTypeNames` | Empty | Imported type names (`import type` or inline `type` specifiers) whose annotated parameters, including optional and inline-destructured ones, are executors inside the declaring function. |

`executorFactoryNames` and `executorTypeNames` add scoped executors: `tx` in
`await using tx = await openTransaction()` or `run` in `run: TxExecutor` is scanned
only inside the block or function that declares it, and a same-named identifier
elsewhere is not. Matching is by configuration only, both default to empty, and
neither counts as executor selection: still set `importSpecifier` or `executorNames`.
With `importSpecifier` set, these two options also match imports from its subpaths
(`@example/db/types` for `@example/db`) but not sibling packages such as
`@example/dbx`; `executorNames` still requires the exact module.

Omitting both options is a configuration error. Set `executorNames: []` without
`importSpecifier` to explicitly skip executor calls (including `.query`).
A configured module or explicit `query` enables `.query` members. A configured module also recognizes
its transaction helpers. Native SQL and recovered SQL-builder fragments retain
their existing scopes. See [the migration notes](../migrations/explicit-postgres-executors.md).

## Valid example

```ts
query(`/* posts/list */ SELECT id FROM posts ORDER BY id DESC`);
```

## Counterexample

```ts
query(`SELECT id FROM posts ORDER BY id DESC`);
```

## Fix

Add a short operation identifier as the first block comment inside the SQL
string passed to the configured executor.

## Suppression

Use `no-mistakes-disable-next-line postgres-require-query-annotation` or
`no-mistakes-disable-line`; use the file directive for a deliberately opaque
administrative script.
