# Rule Applications

Configured rules are reusable applications, not a single ESLint-style map.

```yaml
rules:
  - name: web-public-api
    rule: unique-exports
    projects: [web]
    include: ["src/**/*.ts"]
    exclude: ["src/generated/**"]
    message: Keep exports unique so agents can trace symbols.
```

Common fields: `name`, `rule`, `message`, `enabled`, `projects`, `tests`,
`scope`, `include`, `exclude`, and rule-specific `options`.

Rules are opt-in. `include` and `exclude` filters apply to each rule
application and are interpreted relative to the configured root.
